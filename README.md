This is my Portfolio website yr1,

I've had previous expierience in wordpress and backend ASP and C# as well as some basic Javascript.

My aim was to include libraries from previous P5.js Projects which I think was achieved.


Practices used within my project included:

Bootstrap 4
Javascript
HTML
CSS
P5.js


Wish I had more time to perfect this assignment but time limits are short and giving the extras needed I'm overall very happy.
